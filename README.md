# OpenPNC
An open source HaXe point n' click game engine.

This engine is being developed from scratch in order to create point and click adventure games in HaXe on top of OpenFL.
This engine is still very early in development, and I expect it to take some time before this is mature enough to support a full-featured game, but that is the end goal. Please shoot me an email if you have any questions or would like to help out!
